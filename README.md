# PyTorch for Deep Learning/ GPU accelerated Computing

PyTorch is a well-known Deep Learning framework of Python. Unlike TensorFlow, it provides simple and clear syntax to use so that the learning curve of PyTorch is not that steep comparing to TensorFlow. Its syntax is quite similiar to NumPy such that the learning cost is not that much. Besides, it supports Apple Silicon Metal Performance Shaders (MPS) which allows us to take advantages of Apple Silicon GPU to achive faster computation using parallism. 

In this repository, I am going to build several Machine/Deep learning models with PyTorch such as regression/classifications. Besides, I will also show how GPU computation achive faster computation using built-in API to allocate GPU resorces.
